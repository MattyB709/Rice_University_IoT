# Introduction to IoT Programming, GT Mentorship

This repository contains my work with Dr. Mamouras from Rice University through the FBISD GT Mentorship program
All algorithms are meant to be suitable for implementation in a streaming setting, such as the continuous data received by IoT devices
All code is being done on a seperate, private repository, this is simply a mirror of my completed algorithms

## Projects

**Algorithms I have implemented**
- Find max
- Running average
- Standard deviation
- Most frequent
- Second greatest
- K steps ago
- Find sum and average on a sliding window

**Current project**
- Find max on a sliding window
